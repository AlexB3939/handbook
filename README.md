# 📘 Sourcegraph handbook

The Sourcegraph handbook describes how we (Sourcegraph teammates) work. It’s publicly visible because we are an [open company](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company#open-company).

The handbook is a living document and we expect every teammate to propose improvements, changes, additions, and fixes to keep it continuously up-to-date and accurate.

All content is in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown) files under the [📁 content](./content) folder.

## Run locally
