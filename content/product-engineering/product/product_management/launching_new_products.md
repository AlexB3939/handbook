# Launching new products 

This guide covers launching new [L1 products](../../../marketing/product-marketing/marketing_launch_tiers.md) from a product management perspective. 

> This guide is a work in progress being built up alongside the [Code Insights](../../engineering/code-graph/code-insights/index.md) launch.

## Beta Stage 

### Sales and Customer Engineering playbook  

As you approach the GA (General Availability) launch, you should synthesize the early learnings your team has discovered and share them with the sales and customer engineering teams so they can build momentum before the public launch. 

Given that the go-to-market strategy is likely to evolve even after the launch, you should focus on the empirical patterns related to helping customers find success with the new product. 

A Google slides presentation works well, and can be linked from the team handbook and strategy pages. (It is unlikely the same content can be put directly into the handbook without anonymizing so much customer information that it will lose its impact.) 

#### Questions to answer in the playbook

Useful content for the sales and customer engineering team includes: 

- What customer personas are most likely to get value from the feature? 
- What are ways that sales and customer engineering can reach those personas? 
- What demo use cases of the product most often resonate with customers? 
- What common objections or concerns do customers have, and what are the answers to them? 
- Are there technical or user-experience blockers to be aware of when setting customers up with the new product? 

Here is the [Code Insights first playbook deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16PGodWTZkyyxXUCGaY-wMtTSUKOGyRl-4HhNUG8Ubus/edit#slide=id.gfa6e15e548_0_0) as an example, which was shared two months before the planned launch. 

### Picking a specific launch date

You should work first with your customers and your team to determine answers to:

- What is the minimum lovable feature set that would achieve the goal of the product (usually revenue, or sometimes just adoption)? 
- How long would the team need to build those features to a high-enough quality? 
  - For areas of user experience, extensibility, or user interface, quality is often an infinite, continuous scale and you be conscious of overbuilding these features. We know that [releasing features earlier](index.md#release-early-release-often) leads to the best outcomes. 
  - For areas of security concern or informational correctness (example: the right search results count), quality is often a binary, and the feature should not be launched until this has been achieved. 

It is unlikely you may be able to answer these questions before you reach the beta stage of maturity or before you have a staffed engineering team. Before that point, you can use quarterly or six-month sized windows to plan for a launch date.  

Once you know roughly when the minimum lovable features are feasible to build, partner with your product marketing manager counterpart to figure out where a launch may fit into the Sourcegraph and holidays calendar. 

Consider also that in addition to product features, there may be launch-specific features you need to account for in planning, from marketing content such as blogs and landing pages, to gating and licensing features.
