(and [Tracker)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZjR4jYRucbRnpiFbhAKWvZG4pf8qMRn4lG57GRo3_g/edit#gid=0).
This program was rolled out at the [2022-03-01 Company Update](https://sourcegraph.zoom.us/rec/share/T_CFCvfR1AcWcFmsHT8678ntupe9bIXiZ8UN_H7a55eF_EZqS5gT0cSfd4YQn0w.lqWI83_aS7R2La7L).

# Why

The Exec Team Decision Log (and Tracker) was designed to create a more dynamic, transparent, and reference-able "source of truth" for all exec-level decisions
with the goal of achieving greater alignment, accountability, and impactful decision making across the organization.

## Key Documents

- [Exec Decision Request Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZjR4jYRucbRnpiFbhAKWvZG4pf8qMRn4lG57GRo3_g/edit#gid=0)
  - The Decision Log Tracker is open and available to any Sourcegraph teammate to request a decision or pose a clarifying question to the executive team.
  - These requests will be reviewed weekly on the exec team call.\_
- [Pending Decision Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x8lDPvQ3vOetuTCJacxH9iVdVk-LQvfdXa9J_vZaikw/edit)
  - When a request is under deliberation by the exec team, those requests will live here and be available for company-wide comment and review.
- [Exec Decision Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14snvXSR_SosGfO9GFZHZ4GPy94omcEuDUUKrLdqUQuw/edit#)
  - The historical log and "source of truth" for all key exec team decisions.
- [Exec Decision Long Process Flow](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOLhmfIM=/)
  - A high-level process flow (Miro) of how a decision / point of clarification is requested, deliberated, and decided.

# How

- The decision and clarification requests will be on-going process.
- On a weekly basis, the exec team will review decision and clarification requests. When appropriate, the exec team will select specific requests for deliberation.
- Requests that are selected for deliberation, will be added to the Pending Exec Decision Log document for public comment and review.
- From the time these request enter "deliberation", the exec team has _2 weeks_ to take action:
  - Reject the decision. Rejected decisions will be removed from the Pending Decision Log and moved to the [declined decisions tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZjR4jYRucbRnpiFbhAKWvZG4pf8qMRn4lG57GRo3_g/edit#gid=1071034366)
  - Revisit the decision. Revisited decisions will be removed from the Pending Decision Log and moved to the [executive decision tracker tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZjR4jYRucbRnpiFbhAKWvZG4pf8qMRn4lG57GRo3_g/edit#gid=0)
  - Finalize the decision. Finalized decisions will be removed from the Pending Decision Log and moved to the [executive decision log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14snvXSR_SosGfO9GFZHZ4GPy94omcEuDUUKrLdqUQuw/edit#)
- As decision progress through the process, updates will be shared through the #general slack channel (and any other, relevant channels)
