# **Raising concerns escalation process**

If you have a question or concern about a violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company-info-and-process/communication/code_of_conduct/), speak up.

### **How do I raise a concern?**

You can raise your concerns directly with the People Team at [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

Our People Partners are here to help you work through changes, issues, and concerns. Their purpose is to provide all Sourcegraph teammates an avenue to express workplace concerns and to resolve conflicts in a safe and unbiased forum, without fear of retaliation.

If you feel another channel is more appropriate, you can also Slack, e-mail, or call:

- Your manager
- The Legal Team at [legal@sourcegraph.com](mailto:legal@sourcegraph.com) or [tammy@sourcegraph.com](mailto:tammy@sourcegraph.com)

**Please note:** if you escalate a concern through your Manager, they will need to share your concerns with limited members of the People Team or the Legal Team for proper investigation.

### **When can I expect a response?**

You can expect an initial response acknowledging receipt within 24-hours. Please keep in mind that if you make a report to an individual and they are out of working hours or on PTO, it may take longer for you to get a response. In these cases, if you want a faster response, we recommend that you report to the People Team directly to ensure we address your report as quickly as possible.

### **What do I do if I don’t receive a response? What do I do if my concern is not addressed?**

If you do not receive a response within 24-hours, or if the initial response does not address your concern, please raise your concern to a different channel (of those listed above) or to our anonymous, 24/7 third-party helpline, Convercent. Convercent will anonymously share your report with limited members of the People team or the Legal team so we can look into and respond to your concerns.

### **Will my concern remain confidential?**

When you raise a concern, we make best efforts to keep your identity confidential, except to the extent needed to investigate a report or to comply with laws.

If you are concerned about remaining anonymous, it is better to make an anonymous report through Convercent, than not to report at all.

### **Is Convercent truly anonymous?**

You can review Convercent’s Data Privacy and Trust information [here](https://www.convercent.com/data-privacy-trust). We have opted to not include Convercent in our Okta SSO dashboard to further protect your anonymity, except to the extent needed to investigate a report or comply with laws.
