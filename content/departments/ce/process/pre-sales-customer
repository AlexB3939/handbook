# Pre-Sales Customer Touchpoints

## Discovery and Demo

The initial conversation(s) with a customer can vary in length and scope, but always involve discovery, that is uncovering their needs and motivations, and demonstrating product capabilities. This could range from an abbreviated 30-minute intro call with a smaller prospect, or multiple hour-long calls across various stakeholders and teams at an enterprise organization.

## Technical Design

Early on in the process, we begin to understand the needs of our prospective customers. As we learn about them - their needs, their tech stack, their business, etc. we begin to document both the product and technical requirements and the business context of the deal. Every single prospective customer must have a technical design document established, starting as early as Stage 2 - Qualification and completed into Stage 4 - Technical and Business Validation. We begin by capturing details about their pre-Sourcegraph business and document first their Trial design and configuration, and subsequently their Production design and setup. These TDDs should be stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o-4rB24vcYsOiUzSEr_vzJsC7pE03yYC) and you should also link to the TDD from within your respective prospective customer [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjXWQ1l0Fnt2pVS2ohx3w0cw-gaJ_Ez0) by creating a [shortcut](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in Drive.

For complex engagements, we have internal technical reviews with cross-functional teams (see [technical deal reviews](#technical-deal-reviews) below) that occur before approval to proceed to a trial deployment, to ensure we at Sourcegraph are collectively aligned on their needs and expectations, and so that the customer has the right expectations set and is positioned for success.

## Customer Trials

Trials are an important and strategic part of our sales cycles because when developers start to use Sourcegraph, they love it and want to use it forever. Seriously! Typically, our trials run for about a month but sometimes longer. Before, during and after, you collaborate closely with your account executive to ensure a successful experience for the customer.

Before the trial, you're working with the AE to scope and plan the trial - both use cases they'll test (which you'll enable them on) and technically how they plan to deploy Sourcegraph for the trial.

CE and AE should use the [Trial and Deployment Planning Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mi_540InPEs6_xmCE2gHzw6Vt9QHDx-IdGogQZN6Ezw/edit?usp=sharing) to complete planning activities in advance of trial start. Here's a breakdown of who leads which aspects:

- Documenting their technical landscape (CE-led)
- Trial use cases / metrics for success (CE-led)
- Business value assessment planning (AE-led)
- User survey planning (AE-led)
- Deployment support and checklist (CE-led)
- Technical configuration review (CE-led)
- Trial rollout plan (CE-led)
- Communication and ongoing support (CE-led)

During the trial, CE is enabling and educating the customer on how to use Sourcegraph. CEs orient our activities during the trial against the defined use cases and metrics for success to ensure developers are set up for success. It is the CE's responsibility to deliver the technical win for the trial.

## Security Reviews

Many customers send security questionnaires to complete. They are required to proceed with the partnership. The current process for completing them is:

1. Work with the AE to get access to the security questionnaire.
2. Note the customer preferred deployment type (self-hosted, managed, or cloud).
3. If you (the CE) feel comfortable doing so, take a first pass at the questionnaire. Use the [source of truth document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xtjGzKExX9bEYBrsSyOcHFa-rm0SmB53hWnDKueVJjI/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Talk to your region's CE in charge of security reviews. Have them take a pass at it and review it. Please ensure timelines are properly communicated and enough notice is given to all involved stakeholders.
5. If the Security CE feels it necessary, they may involve the product manager on the security team. Typically this involves asking one-off questions in the security [source of truth document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xtjGzKExX9bEYBrsSyOcHFa-rm0SmB53hWnDKueVJjI/edit?usp=sharing), but they may also request full security questionnaire reviews. Note that full reviews may require extra time to get prioritized and worked on by the security team.

The current CE's in charge of security questionnaires are [Max Wiederholt](../../../team/index.md#max-wiederholt) for US West / APAC and [Shawn King](../../../team/index.md#shawn-king) for US East / EMEA. We occasionally rotate team members in this role.

## License Keys

CEs are the team responsible for generating and maintaining license keys for customers. Here's some useful resources on how to do that:
