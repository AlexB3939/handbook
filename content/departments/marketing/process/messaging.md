# Sourcegraph messaging

## What problems does Sourcegraph solve?

Developers and technologists play a critical role in the development of new products and features, but they can get pulled off course for many reasons. Each time they’re pulled off course and out of their flow state, that’s a hit to productivity and efficiency - both on the team level and on the larger business level.

Getting pulled off course can look like encountering a new challenge, getting asked a question from a colleague, or resolving an uncommon error.

Sourcegraph helps the effeciency and velocity of development teams by helping them uderstand, fix, and automate their entire codebase.

## Definitions

- **Code search** - Essential task for all developers to quickly find, understand, and change all of the code that they are responsible for. Includes the activities of code discovery, code intelligence, and code change management.
- **Code navigation** - Guided traveling to find specific code via ad-hoc query (enables code discovery and exploration)
- **Code exploration** - Find both known and unknown code, with code intelligence providing the contextual understanding
- **Code discovery** - Navigate, explore, and understand the code you are looking for, even if you didn’t know it existed
- **Code intelligence** - Display and share additional contextual information around code (allows code reviews with context)
- **Batch Changes** - Make large-scale code changes
