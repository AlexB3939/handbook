# Recruitment Metrics

## What we measure

COMING SOON

## Estimated time-to-hire

It is our goal to fill our openings as quickly as possible while maintaining a high quality bar and a strong candidate experience. Our time-to-fill goal is an average of 45 days. This means that the timespan from intake meeting to candidate offer acceptance (when a candidate signs their offer letter) should be, on average, 45 days or less.

- (45 days time-to-fill) + (2-4 weeks notice period) + (1-2 weeks vacation in between jobs) = 3 months from the time we kick off the job to when our new teammate starts.
- All roles should be kicked off 2-3 months prior to our target start date to ensure we're taking a proactive, rather than reactive, recruitment approach.
- Once a candidate begins the interview process with us, we should aim to complete the interview process in **2-weeks** or less.
