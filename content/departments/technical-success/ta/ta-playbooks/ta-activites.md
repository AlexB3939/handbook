  - TA Team Meeting will be held on a bi-weekly basis. Topics will include team announcements, training of new processes as we roll things out, and active discussion amongst the team on customer situations.
- Yellow/Red Renewals Meeting
  - 180 days out from renewal, we check each accounts health. If it falls into our red or yellow categories, the account will be raised for review at the Yellow/Red Renewals meeting. The goal here is to get the customer healthy and protect the renewal as much as possible.
