# TA Cadences

## Daily

### Internal

- Check your list of Vitally Tasks
  - Vitally will auto-assign a number of tasks based on the playbooks we have configured. You also have the ability to set these tasks on your own based on your conversations with customers. You should be driving this list to completion as much as possible.
- Account teams comms
  - Be a good teammate! Make sure to update your Account Executive, Customer Engineer or SDR with any information that could effect their work, even if it is just a status update.
  - Collaborate with your team on activities that would help the goals you have with customers like feature adoption or upgrading.

### External

- Ad-hoc customer calls
  - This could be trainings, check-in calls, troubleshooting, whatever meetings need to be set up to facilitate the customer's journey with Sourcegraph.

## Weekly

### Internal

- Bi-Weekly Team Check In
  - TA Team Meeting will be held on a bi-weekly basis. Topics will include team announcements, training of new processes as we roll things out, and active discussion amongst the team on customer situations.
- Yellow/Red Renewals Meeting
  - 180 days out from renewal, we check each accounts health. If it falls into our red or yellow categories, the account will be raised for review at the Yellow/Red Renewals meeting. The goal here is to get the customer healthy and protect the renewal as much as possible.
- Vitally Traits
  - Vitally is where we keep the state of a customer, including information around deployment, new feature adoption and customer comms. Make sure that you are keeping this up to date and reviewing your accounts weekly to make sure that the information is up to date for leadership

### External

- Review customer pings and data to determine what could be done to help improve their health, see [TA Activites](../ta-activites.md), and strategize with your champion.

## Monthly

### Internal

- Bi-Monthly Health Score Updates
  - A Vitally project will trigger each month for every account that reminds you to update the Pulse, Access to Buyer and Active Champion traits.

### External

- Announce version and patch updates to customers, if an issue or feature request a customer has reported is included in an upgrade or patch make sure they know!

## Quarterly

### Internal

- Review accounts with your manager, this can be done ad-hoc weekly/monthly but make sure that you are maintaining visability into all of your accounts with your manager.

### External

- Sourcegraph QBR's
  - Sourcegraph traditionally holds QBR's with customers team during the first few weeks of the quarter on a case by case basis.
  - [QBR resources](../team-culture/working-with-customers.md/#qbrs)
- Prepare for [renewals](../team-culture/working-with-customers.md/#renewal-process)

## As Needed

### New Customers

- Knowledge transfer with sales team
- [Partnership kickoff](../team-culture/working-with-customers.md/#post-sales-partnership-kickoff)

### Account Transitions

- As new business closes TA's will be assigned to accounts to lead them through the Onboarding and Enablement process.

# General Customer Interaction

- Email, Slack, Zoom, or even in-person are all potential ways that you'll be interacting with your customers. Every customer should be contacted in some form at least once a month.
- Customer check-ins, these will take varying forms depending on the relationship with the customer, the idea is to make sure we are maintaining a high level of engagement with each customer.
  - These would be a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly all the way to quarterly 30-60 minute call, depending on the customer
  - For healthy accounts this could be a quick email or slack message
