- Yellow/Red Renewals Meeting
  - 180 days out from renewal, we check each accounts health. If it falls into our red or yellow categories, the account will be raised for review at the Yellow/Red Renewals meeting. The goal here is to get the customer healthy and protect the renewal as much as possible.

### Daily

## Internal

- Check your list of Vitally Tasks
  - Vitally will auto-assign a number of tasks based on the playbooks we have configured. You also have the ability to set these tasks on your own based on your conversations with customers. You should be driving this list to completion as much as possible.
- Account teams comms
  - Be a good teammate! Make sure to update your Account Executive, Customer Engineer or SDR with any information that could effect their work, even if it is just a status update.

## External

- Ad-hoc customer calls
  - This could be trainings, check-in calls, troubleshooting, whatever meetings need to be set up to facilitate the customer's journey with sourcegraph.

## As Needed

### New Customers

- Knowledge transfer with sales team
- Partnership kickoff

### Account Transitions

- As new business closes TA's will be assigned to accounts to lead them through the Onboarding and Enablement process.

# General Customer Interaction

- Email, Slack, Zoom, or even in-person are all potential ways that you'll be interacting with your customers. Every customer should be contacted in some form at least once a month.
- Customer check-ins, these will take varying forms depending on the relationship with the customer, the idea is to make sure we are maintaining a high level of engagement with each customer.
  - These would be a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly all the way to quarterly 30-60 minute call, depending on the customer
  - For healthy accounts this could be a quick email or slack message
