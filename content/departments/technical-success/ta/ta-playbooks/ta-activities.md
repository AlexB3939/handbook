# What should I be doing?

## My customer is just now signing with Sourcegraph:

- Complete the CE to TA Account Handoff Project
- Complete the New Customer Onboarding and Enablement Project
- Achieve 80% MAU/Seats within 45 days of implementation\*
  - Implementation is expected to be completed within the first few weeks for non-Implementation Engineering involved accounts or Managed Instances.

## My customer has a MAU / Seats below 80%:

- Complete the Customer Health - Low Utilization Project
  - Initial inspection of the account and comprehensive Get Well Plan
  - Weekly updates to the Get Well Plan Status
  - Tasks created in Vitally to keep track of your action items.

## My customer is renewing in the next six months, and their health score in Vitally is either Red or Yellow:

- Account will be flagged into a Red/Yellow Renewals Review process for extra help and attention.

## My customer is renewing in the next 180 days:

-Complete the Health Assessment Project to ensure they are properly categorized.

- IF account is Red / Yellow health category
  - Complete the Get Well project
    - Initial inspection of the account and comprehensive Get Well Plan
    - Weekly updates to the Get Well Plan Status
    - Tasks created in Vitally to keep track of your action items.

## My customer has a Yellow or Red health score:

- Review the traits that make up the health score
- Going to the account and expanding the health sections will tell you which traits are causing the issues
- These traits are explained in more detail here (../team-culture/working-with-customers/.md#customer-health)

## My customer has a low TA Pulse:

- This is more subjective, since you know why you are putting this score you will already know what big issue needs to be addressed. Escalate this to leadership if necessary to bring in the right resources.

## My customer has a low Technical Health Score / Last Month Versions Behind:

- Review notes to see if they have deployment challenges.
- Pull information about the biggest improvements from their current version and our latest release.
- Relate those improvements back to their engineering goals.
- Ensure they are aware of multi-version upgrades.
- Evaluate the deployment and see if they are set up for long-term success. A deployment change might be useful based on our updated methods.
- Sync with the AE and evaluate if a switch to Cloud makes sense.

## My customer does not have an active champion:

- Customers as of Jan 1, 2023 without an active champion have been identified and are being paired with exec sponsors to help reengage.
- If a customer falls into this category after the fact, mark the customer as a Red Account via the Account - Red Account? trait on the Vitally account. This will trigger a thread in #red-accounts so that we can strategize on a plan to identify and build new champions.

## My customer does not have an active buyer that we have access to:

- Sync as an account team and escalate as needed to get Sourcegraph exec help rebuilding that connection.
- Work with your champion to collect internal wins that came from using Sourcegraph along with feedback.
- Create a QBR style presentation for your champion showing that value so that they can present Sourcegraph internally and gain support for their initiatives.

## My customer has not been contacted in X number of days:

- Never reach out just to reach out, always work to bring something of value to the customer. This could be a new feature we have released, a new blog post or piece of collateral we’ve created, or some piece of industry news (Log4J) that you believe might affect them PAIRED with some guidance from Sourcegraph.

## My customer has a low Usage Score:

- \*\* Usage Score is DAU/MAU, weighted based on customer tenure, along a scale from 0-100. Technical health score is calculated monthly on the first of the month, using data from the previous month. So we calculated scores on Dec 1 for the month of November. DAU is an average of the daily active users for the month of November. MAU is the total MAUs for the month of November.
- Usage Score is a direct reflection of how active the MAU’s are. You could have 100% MAU / Seats but if everyone only logged in once, your Usage Score would be low.
- Dig into the customer’s day to day activities. Work on building an org chart with the intent of identifying all the teams and what they do specifically in the engineering org. With this information you will be able to do better team by team enablement by understanding what they do on a daily basis. By then reviewing that and seeing how Sourcegraph can help accomplish those goals and tasks we will help developers add Sourcegraph to their daily workflow
- This is more of a responsive approach (You can use Batch Changes to help with any migrations, do you have any migrations coming up? Vs. “We’re working through a project now where we need to upgrade our terraform packages across teams.”)
- Listen and advise.

## My customer has low MAU / Seats:

- Low MAU / Seats can happen for a number of reasons also related to the previous traits and should be taken into account.
- Being too many versions behind might have led to a bad user experience for the customer end users.
- Lacking a champion might mean Sourcegraph is not being vocalized internally
- Low usage score might mean we do not have enough power users to evanglize Sourcegraph internally. The more people who use Sourcegraph regularly, the easier it will be to see big customer wins and spread naturally.
