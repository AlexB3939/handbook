# Support prioritization

We have many factors to consider in order to determine priorities and as such, we need very clear boundaries and definitions to ensure there is only ever a single number one priority and it’s straightforward to determine what that is.

## Support exceptions

We **no longer** offer tier 1 support for pre-sales/trial customers.

However, we have exceptions to provide support if our CE teammates open a ticket on behalf of the customer
in instances where trial customers run into issues that;

1. Are a critical blocker and what we'd define as a p0/sev 0. For example, `failed deployment` or `total loss of service` etc.

or

2. Are severe impact where several users and/or core features are affected. What we'd define as a p1/sev 1. For example, `slow service`, `core feature unavailability` etc.

## Priority definitions

All work is assigned a priority per these definitions:

- **p0:** All customers (including those in the pre-sales process) reported issues per our contractual p0 service level agreement definition [here](../index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).
- **p1:** All customer (including those in the pre-sales process) reported issues per our contractual p1 service level agreement definition [here](../index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).
- **p2:** Paying customers who have reported issues per our contractual p2 service level agreement definition [here](../index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).
- **p3:** Any internally identified goals/tasks/projects.

## Time allocations

80% of our time is spent on p2 work (with p0 amd p1 work being rare). 20% of our time is spent on internally identified goals/tasks/projects.

## Making hard choices

Sometimes we have too much work to keep it simple. In these situations, we will put forth our best effort and unless something about the situation requires us to deviate, we follow this order of priority:

- Pre-sales customers first(See #Support exceptions above)
- Enterprise customers second
- Team customers third
- Free customers fourth
- Open source fifth
- Internally driven work last

When we have a normal amount of work, we help when help is needed and even with severity level based SLAs, we still strive to get back to customers (including pre-sales) within a couple of hours most of the time.

When we have an unusually large amount of work or more folks are out than normal, it is fine if customers (including pre-sales) have to wait. In such situations, we will communicate proactively, letting them know that we have team members arriving in another few hours who will be able to help them.

## Priority assignment

Priority is always assigned by us, sometimes with input from the customer and/or other internal teams/practices/contractual obligations. We will only expect engineering to drop everything for p0 and p1 issues if they really cannot wait a day. Either way, the idea is that we expect very few p0 and p1 issues overall, so the need to drop everything should be rare. This also means that it’s okay for p2 issues to sit a bit before engineering takes a look and decides timing for work. The onus will be on support to provide all the necessary context for engineering to decide how to handle p2 issues.
