## View on customer support

I believe customer support is an important department which helps in generating revenue and establishing the product. If you can think like a customer half of the battle is won, also good communication and working on feedbacks are important to deliver high quality of support.

## Preferred learning style

I believe learning while you work stays for long , I am more into practical learning than theory.

## Communication style

I prefer written communication (Slack DMs, email, etc).

## Collaboration style

I work best in one-on-one situations or in _small_ groups, preferably over Zoom because I like to be "face to face".

## Approach to problems

I read the problem statement carefully, pay attention to keywords and try to use my experience/expertise to replicate the problem and identify the root cause. If I am completely unaware of the topic, I use different channels available internally or externally like Google, Stack Overflow or internal wiki, case history etc.

## Preferred way to be recognized

I believe appreciation for good work is always a motivating factor.

## What I enjoy at work

Everyday learning something new while talking to teammates or from customers while working on their problems.

## Thoughts on asking for help

I think asking for help is completely fine. If I have given it my best shot and still can't figure out the problem, I am not hestitant to reach out to people who might know the answer or guide me in right direction.

## Preferred time to work

I like to work 10:30-6:30 as my mornings are bit busier.

## Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

I prefer responding to only urgent matters during non working hours.

## How to show up when I'm feeling off

I take a long breathe and meditate for sometime to start afresh.

## Things that make me anxious

Communication deadlocks, too much of processes.

## Technical areas of knowledge

I have supported applications developed in Java, dot net, powerbuilder with oracle, sql server as backend deployed on unix, windows, linux os.

## Technical interests to learn

- Cloud platforms
- Kubernetes

## Current personal project

Learning how to read music and playing piano.

## What I fear

Free fall
