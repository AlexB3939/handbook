# Kubernetes Crash Course

The following crash course is intended to provide a new application engineer with the basics they need to get up and running with kubernetes (also called k8s). The course will provide a brief exploration of key kubernetes concepts and administrative operations, as well as information about how these concepts may be employed when working with a kubernetes Sourcegraph deployment.

Kubernetes was developed to make life easier for admins and devOps teams tasked with deploying and maintaining complex web applications. As such, a wide range of devOps subfields, from machine networking, to linux file system permissions, are within the scope of a kubernetes deployment. This document is intended to explore kubernetes broadly, and provide someone new to kubenetes with the basic concepts and tools necessary to navigate a kubernetes application.
