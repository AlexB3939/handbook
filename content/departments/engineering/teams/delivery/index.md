### Requesting our support

Feel free to direct simple questions to us in [#delivery](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02E4HE42BX) in Slack. As a rule of thumb, anything that is not documented in our handbook or [docsite](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/) usually indicates it is not a simple question (e.g. feature requests) and should follow our [support request guidelines](./#support-request-guidelines) below.

- This channel _is_ regularly checked and well-monitored
- So please do **NOT** directly message or CC an engineer‚Äîthis is to try and protect their focus
- Instead, if it‚Äôs urgent, please @ either the PM or the EM in the question in the channel and we'll ensure it gets the best response

### Support request guidelines

Support requests related to our [areas of ownership](index.md#responsibilities) should follow this process:

1. Make sure there is an issue‚Äîif there's not, please create one and include:
   - A short description of the ask
   - A more detailed explanation of the background, the context and the challenge that needs solving
   - Any guidance related to the impact this is having
   - Any extra information that could help us solve or prioritize this
2. Ensure lable `team/delivery` is added to the issue
3. Ensure that the issue is added to the "[Delivery](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/205)" board in GitHub
4. Anything without a status is checked and triaged weekly - so this is enough for feature requests or less urgent issues
5. If you think this needs eyes üëÄ sooner
   - Within a few hours ‚û°Ô∏è message in [#delivery](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02E4HE42BX)
