### Working in APAC

I get a lot of questions on how I manage working in KST (GMT +9) as a designer. To provide clarity for my teams and anyone who wants to understand when I am available, here’s a breakdown of my work hours.

I follow one of two work schedules:

1. I start my days late starting from 4pm-12AM KST. This allows me to have overlap with teammates in European timezones starting from 4-5PM and overlap with USA teammates starting from 9-10PM (depending on timezone).
2. I start my morning time (8AM onwards) on days where I would like quiet focus time or on days I have 1:1’s with teammates based in PST. I attend any team rituals that likely start around 10PM KST.

This means that I overlap a minimum of 6 hours every work day with teammates who are based in Europe. I overlap around 2-3 hours a day for teammates who are based in USA CST/EST. For teammates working PST hours, I can be available 2-3 hours in my morning time, which correlates to 4-7PM PST.

This work style predicates that I promote and work effectively asynchronously, as most of my overlapping hours are booked every day for team rituals. Starting and ending my day earlier than the rest of the world, I ensure that work requiring collaboration is prioritized and documented.

I also get asked: are these work hours sustainable? I’m a night owl and much prefer working later than early hours. I also really enjoy the freedom to have focus time in my morning hours when no one is online or the freedom to spend “typical work hours” doing something else.

I’m always open to feedback and suggestions for how I can better collaborate with teammates. I’ll also continually look for opportunities to promote ways my teams can work more asynchronously. I hope my being in APAC will act as a catalyst for Sourcegraph to improve on our value of being async-first!
