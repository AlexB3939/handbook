# Product designer onboarding

Welcome to the Design Team!

Having gone though [the Process St onboarding](https://app.process.st/reports/) and [product onboarding](../../product/onboarding/index.md), it's time for the design onboarding!

Your perspective as both a new user of Sourcegraph and a new teammate is very valuable to us. Please keep notes on any issues you encounter as you are onboarding and learning the product. Weâ€™ll use those notes to improve the product and process.

## Designer checklist

### Analogous products

- Get familiar with the products that we use as inspirations for reference in the developer tools industry:
  - code hosts: [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
  - code editors: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (and other IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/))
  - similar products: [grepp.app](https://grep.app/) and [cs.opensource.google](https://cs.opensource.google)

### Handbook

- Read the [Product Design team handbook](../index.md), especially:
  - [User research](../research/)
  - [Analytics and product design](../metrics/)
  - [Wildcard design system](../wildcard_design_system/)

### Set up your design environment

- Set up Figma
  - Download [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
  - Install Figma plugins:
    - [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/Contrast) - Color Contrast Checker - handy tool to check if your designs meet our [accessibility standards](../../design/design-and-interaction-guidelines.md#accessibility-standards)
    - [Iconify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify) - We use the material design icons which can be searched and included with this plugin
    - [PageFlow](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/950120156580543496/PageFlow) - Quickly create new pages in Figma with Emojis. Helps us stay efficient.
    - Suggest plugins to help make us more efficient!
  - Install the font SF PRO, which can be found in the [drive type folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X1hwQr4lGGVn5BDe4f09q_xRqboQZpsQ)
  - Consider set nudge to 8px in preferences > nudge amount
- Review the [Wildcard design system](https://www.figma.com/file/NIsN34NH7lPu04olBzddTw/%E2%9C%B3%EF%B8%8F-Wildcard-Design-System?node-id=21423-49011&t=bIFjBLnZfICXvveE-0) (product design) and/or [Marketing DLS](https://www.figma.com/file/o1QRtdQI0ozKq0n7ATrKlx/Marketing-DLS?node-id=916-5781&t=6MQaleEHd9xtVq3Y-0) (brand design).

### Access our other tools

#it-tech-ops generally grants access to most tools. Typically they must add you as a user to Okta, then the tool you need access to must be configured. If there are issues with accessing any of the below, as in #it-tech-ops.

- [app.dovetail.com](https://dovetailapp.com/auth/login/)
- [userTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)
  - Review a few tests
- [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) some wireframing is done with this tool
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=5f0f381c0e50750022dc6bf7)
  - We use Chromatic to access and collaborate on our Storybook components. You can access the React components library by:
  - Log into Chromatic with your GitHub account and open Sourcegraph library

### Get familiar with product artifacts

- Drive
  - Explore and favorite the [Google Drive design folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ow-19Yd4AFtT8HjVZ9ln_nEGpCzQ2CTf), [RFCs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zP3FxdDlcSQGC1qvM9lHZRaHH4I9Jwwa), and [PRFaqs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cOXPKDIQ3O3ZEq9oP6WZBTizgwnoZI9l) folers
- Explore GitHub issues

## Creating your first Figma project

- Try to standardize on the following conventions so that everyone can quickly understand your project and it's current state:
  - Name pages consistently (the PageFlow plugin helps with this), use emojis to help indicate purpose
  - Use a [cover page and cover component](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/%F0%9F%9B%A0Project-Tools?node-id=72-36) to help with readibly
  - Use an About section on each page to desribe the project. Add links to relevant issues, documents, and research.

## UX End-To-End Review

We typically start you out with an end-to-end review UX review of a portion of the product. This helps you become familiar with the product, bring potential improvements to the team quickly, and potentially find problems that can be fixed in your next effort.

### How to create an End-To-End Review

We recommend using Quicktime to record your screen. Audio is not needed, but if you want to record your thoughts during the proccess feel free to do so. You can also use any other software to record your screen, as long as the final video can be watched by everyone.

Then you may duplicate and fillout [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ct4Fy4H6TLgkUwEdap121-NkvIMMlBp5J7oowmvz3Tk/edit?usp=sharing) with the issues you found and the related timestamps for the video.
If you choose to upload your video to google drive, you can add the time stamps by appending "/view?t=1m05s" to the video URL

Then, coordinate with you manager and share the results with the design team.
