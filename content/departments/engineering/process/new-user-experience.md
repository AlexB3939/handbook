# Collaborating on the new user experience

The new user experience (NUE) crosses the bounds of several teams' ownership areas. For example, a visitor to the product may view the home page, search several times, learn about Code Insights and then try to create a Batch Change. Throughout this journey, they should be informed as to the major functionality and use cases of Sourcegraph as well as how to use each feature.

No one team or organization can effectively own this entire experience, so careful collaboration is required to avoid duplication of efforts and help our users find success with Sourcegraph.

Teams own user education for their specific product areas. They collaborate to promote feature discovery in places like search results, repository pages, and other areas of the application where integration opportunities exist.
