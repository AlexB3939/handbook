## Account Onboarding

Account onboarding consists of ensuring a successful production roll-out, user and admin onboarding, and agreeing an ongoing engagement plan with the customer. The CE is responsible for planning the onboarding and production roll-out, whilst the AE is responsible for agreeing the plan with the Champion and getting customer commitment on attendence to the activities and ongoing engagement. Work with the champion to build a plan of action, agreed milestones and targets, and access to the org necessary to onboard other aspects such as support and enablement.

**Playbook**:

* Once an opportunity hits sales stage 6 (the EB has signed off on the deal), the account team will set-up a prep call to discuss account onboarding. They will create a copy of the relevant engagement document (for the account tier) and agree both a set of activities for onboarding, and a cadence of regular activities for ongoing success. At this time, the CE will start the Production Roll-out plabook.

* The onboarding and engagement plans will then be shared with the account champion to get their thoughts, buy-in and commitment. For example, the account team might seek commitment for the EB to attend business reviews. The champion will first agree if this is possible, and then get commitment from the EB of their attendence. The plan will include a list of steps and commitments that must be carried out, and progress of these actions will be tracked here.

* The account team will build a kick-off deck and a communication plan for the customer

* Once the opportunity progresses to stage 7 (closed won), the account team will book the kick-off meeting with agreed participants, and once this meeting has happened (and the plan explained and final buy-in from all parties bought), onboarding and regular meetings will be booked with the customer and internally

## Account Planning

The account team, along with CE leadership for Tier 1 accounts, and others as necessary, meet to review the state of the account and agree the objectives and plan for the upcoming quarter (when we refer to quarter, we mean a Sourcegraph financial quarter). This continues every quarter and only applies to enterprise accounts.

Whilst the  Planning starts as early as Sales stage 5, and continues every quarter for the life-time of the account.

**Playbook**:

* For Tier 1 accounts account planning will start up to two weeks prior to the start of the next quarter, to allow time for planning to be finished in time to present at the sales QBRs. For Tier 2 and 3 accounts, planning will happen in the first month of the quarter.
* The CE team will set-up an account planning meeting. To prepare for this meeting, the CE will gather the following information:
  * Technical Design Document
  * Current status on all Product Gaps and open support tickets
  * Account health
  * Any other documented risks & blockers

* The planning meeting is run by the CE and will include the AE and, for tier 1 accounts, CE Leadership.
  * For first time meetings, a new account plan document is created with the business context filled in and opportunities, risks, and blockers identified. Then a set of objectives for this quarter (and, where appropriate, next) are agreed and, finally, some concrete next steps.
  * For repeat meetings, the previous quarter's objectives are reviewed to understand progress or any new blockers. The context, opportunities, risks, and blockers are updated and a new set of objectives and next steps agreed.

* In some cases, the plan may make asks from functions other than AE and CE (e.g. asking a PM to talk to a customer, or having marketing run an event). In such a case these asks will be reviewed must seek approval from these other departments.

* As part of their weekly internal catch-up, the account team will review the status of the account according to the Account Plan, and update the concrete next steps to stay aligned to the plan. The plan may need to be updated in time, in which case the plan document is updated with the changes; if any cross-fucntional asks change, these will need review and approval.

* CE Leadership will also review progress of the plan as part of weekly account inspection. Each quarter the leader will ensure the meeting is planned, and once held will review the next step to be taken to progress the plan.

## Production Planning

Production planning happens during account onboarding, and whenever a significant change to the production environment is needed (that is why Production Planning is its own Playbook).
