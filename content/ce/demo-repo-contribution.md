# Contributing to the Demo Repository

We've moved the demo repository from the Google doc to a GitHub repo. We'll be able to keep the repo more organized and modular. If you want to pull out certain things for your demo, you can.

### Content
There can be all sorts of content in this repo. Customer engineers need to be able to demonstrate the function, use case, and value of a feature in order to complete the technical win.

Contenct should be structured to show the Use Case, Discussion, Steps, Value and tagged with the proper tags to make finding the information easy.

### Structure
There is a template in the GitHub repo that describes how the particular demo should be structured.

#### Title
This should be a heading in the demo script.

#### Use Case
A summmary from a customer's perspective about a problem that they're trying to solve. Writing this from the customer's perspective allows us to think about what they're trying to do with our software, and construct our demo accordingly.

#### Discussion

Written from our perspective. Add a detailed description of the customer's use case, how they're accomplishing this now, and how Sourcegraph can help them either accomplish this overall or improve their workflow.

#### Steps
This section describes the functionality of Sourcegraph. It can include as much content as you wish that pertains to the use case. Use search examples, scripts, Sourcegraph Notebooks, anything that a customer engineer can use to demonstrate a use case to a customer and show value in Sourcegraph functionality.

#### Value
This is a summary from our perspective about how Sourcegraph functionality is able to provide value to a customer. Use whichever case studies or metrics you like to help show that value.

#### Tags
Use tags if you wish to make items discoverable.
