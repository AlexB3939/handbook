# Customer Success Model

The primary purpose for Customer Success is to achieve as high customer retention as possible. The secondary purpose is to provide a foundation for expansion in the account.

This is achieved from working with the customer to ensure they get value from using Sourcegraph, in an ongoing basis.

Customer success is goal driven. Key results are defined on a quarterly basis for each account; these are defined as targets against key metrics (including adoption, usage, activities, sentiment, etc.).

Our customer success model is driven by our values.

## Values

### Customer-first

We seek to understand as much as we can about our customers: What's important to them; how they build, deliver, and support software; etc.

### Work as a team

Customer success is a team sport. The CE is accountable for the north star metric of retention, but achieving a happy customer that wants to buy more requires multiple people both at Sourcefgraph and from the customer.

### High agency

In order to take proactive steps, it helps to have the time and the space to reflect and think strategically about our customers. Regular activities (such as QBRs, and account reviews) ensure everyone has time to think more deeply about Sourcegraph and the customer.

### High quality

Consistent application of best practices ensure customers get a high quality experience. This comes in the form of playbooks, alerts, and automation. Furthermore, accounts will be segmented to ensure the experience is tailored.

### Be welcoming and inclusive

Making our customers feel valued is important. This includes providing customers with updates on feedback they provide us.

### Open and transparent

Share as much as possible with the customer. Have as many details mutually agreed with the customer. The "Customer Playbook" will provide a common source of truth of how Sourcegraph is used, jointly owned and authored by Sourcegraph and the customer.

### Continuously grow

Be data driven. Reflect on what has worked historically to inform what should be done in the future. The same data that defines the metrics by which a customer's account is measured, will also be analysed to understand what good looks like, and what actions are effective at driving positive outcomes.

## Goals

### Drive adoption and usage

To get maximum value from Sourcegraph, customers should be using it as frequently as possible, and as many features as possible. Part of this is achieved by finding more use-cases for the customer; part of it is achieved through user enablement; [ANY MORE?].

**Metrics**:

- DAU/MAU
- MAU/Seats
- Product usage statistics
- Size of average session
- Number of extensions used
- [ANY MORE?]

**Activities**:

- QBRs
- Customer Training Webinars
- Customer Workshops
- [ANY MORE?]

### Find and build advocates

Advocates both:

- act as the voice of the end-user
- drum up awareness and excitement for Sourcegraph

They are an important part in driving adoption and usage. They give us a pulse into user sentiment. Through feedback they help us tailor and improve both the experience and product.

**Metrics**:

- Number of advocates
- Number of teams with MAUs

**Activities**:

- Regular Check in

### Validation of business case

A business case outlines the expected value Sourcegraph brings to a customer. A customer's expectations are set against this, and their argument to renew, and their appetite to expand, are achieved when they are confident Sourcegraph is in fact delivering against the promise. Customer success should ensure the business case is achievable, and achieved, updating when necessary as business conditions change.

**Metrics**:

**Activities**:

- Executive Check in
- QBR
- Champion Check in

### Maintain an in-depth knowledge of the account

There are 5 key areas that must be known and understood in order to ensure a customer sees as much value and experiences as little pain as possible with Sourcegraph. They are:

- Organisation: How is the customer organised? What development teams exist? How do they communicate? What initiatives affect these organisations, and how are they measured?
- People:
- Processes:
- Tooling:
- Infrastructure:

**Metrics**:

- Number of advocates
- Number of teams with MAUs

**Activities**:

- Executive Check in
- QBR
- Champion Check in

### Ensure effective support structure

Some customers will look to provide an internal support structure for their use of Sourcegraph, funnelling day-to-day user questions. When that fails, they will fallback to using Sourcegraph's support. For all other customers, there should still be an understanding of how to engage with Sourcegraph's support (vs, say, the account team). Setting up channels and helping make any customer's internal support successful will be important.

**Metrics**:

**Activities**:

### Ensure effective customer enablement

Ensuring the customer is fully able to deploy, configure, and use Sourcegraph (including new features) is essential to them driving maximum value. Enablement is an ongoing goal because new features will be released, and as more use-cases are uncovered we will need to help the customer know how to use Sourcegraph for those use-cases.

**Metrics**:

**Activities**:

### Ensure effective product feedback

Customers will raise bug feature requests, and sometimes roadmap items will benefit that customer (or may have beta programs that the customer may be interested in joining). Agreeing channels for clear, consistent, and frequent updates of all requests, issues, and roadmap news, will build trust.

**Metrics**:

**Activities**:

## Account Tiering

At one end of account tiering is Tier 1 Enterprises. These are our larger accounts, often with huge expansion potential. They warrant and need a very bespoke experience.

On the other end of account tiering is Commercial. Due to their size, they have far less demanding requirements, and so a scalable approach is required. Automation and customer self-serve form the basis of this experience.

For accounts in between, it will be a mix of the two approaches (and indeed, even Tier 1 Enterprises will benefit from automation and self-serve).

Subsequently, all activities have both a manual, customer self-serve, and automated versions.

## Phases

### Land

Success starts pre-sales. It starts with the gathering of details about the account, understanding use-cases, and ensuring the solution is fit for purpose.

### Establish

Whilst the customer onboards, and their usage grows to hit agreed targets as outlined in the business case.

### Grow

Expansion of the account beyond the existing business case.

### Maintain

Ongoing maintenance of an account against the business case.

### Retire

A business case is no longer sustainable.

### Production Planning

Planning for production rollout should start happening in sales stage 3. Part of this is solution design, part of it is lining up resources from both Sourcegraph and the customer to both perform and validate/support the deployment, and building a mutual plan that defines actions that must be carried out by Sourcegraph, the customer, or both. If a solution is especially complex, non-standard, or for a designated account, a technical review of the solution will be required.
