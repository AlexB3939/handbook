# Customer Success Model

The primary goal for Customer Success is to achieve high customer retention and provide a solid foundation for expansion into the account. This is achieved by engaging with the customer in an ongoing fashion. This model defines a consistent approach for customer engagement to achieve these goals.

This page outlines the [values](#values) and [goals](#goals) of Customer Success at Sourcegraph. It provides a high-level overview of the [customer journey](#customer-success-journey) and what activities will take place at each point. Activities are organised around [Playbooks](customer-success-playbooks.md), which provide a consistent best practise approach to certain predictable and repeatable customer situations. Each activity can also deliver [documents](customer-success-deliverables.md) (which will be based on a [library of templates](customer-success-deliverables.md)) as part of its output.

The Customer Success motion will be rolled out over time and so this handbook will be updated as more playbooks are released. As such this current version is not the final and complete version.

## Values

Our customer success model is driven by our values.

### Customer-first

We seek to understand as much as we can about our customers: What's important to them; how they build, deliver, and support software; etc.

### Work as a team

Customer success is a team sport. The CE is accountable for the north star metric of retention, but it takes a village to provide the experience we want to offer the customer.

### High agency

In order to take proactive steps, it helps to have the time and the space to reflect and think strategically about our customers. Regular activities (such as QBRs, and account reviews) ensure everyone has time to think more deeply about Sourcegraph and the customer.

### High quality

Consistent application of best practices ensure customers get a high quality experience. This comes in the form of playbooks, alerts, and automation. Furthermore, accounts will be segmented to ensure the experience is tailored.

### Be welcoming and inclusive

Making our customers feel valued is important. This includes providing customers with updates on feedback they provide us.

### Open and transparent

Share as much as possible with the customer. Have as many details mutually agreed with the customer. The "Customer Playbook" will provide a common source of truth of how Sourcegraph is used, jointly owned and authored by Sourcegraph and the customer.

### Continuously grow

Be data driven. Reflect on what has worked historically to inform what should be done in the future. The same data that defines the metrics by which a customer's account is measured, will also be analysed to understand what good looks like, and what actions are effective at driving positive outcomes.

## Goals

### Drive adoption and usage

To get maximum value from Sourcegraph, customers should be using it as frequently as possible, and as many features as possible. Part of this is achieved by finding more use-cases for the customer, part of it is achieved through user enablement.

**Metrics**:

- DAU/MAU
- MAU/Seats
- Product usage statistics
- Size of average session
- Number of extensions used

**Playbooks**:

- [Account Onboarding](customer-success-playbooks.md#account-onboarding)
- [QBRs](customer-success-playbooks.md#business-review-with-customer)

### Nuture advocates and champions

Advocates both:

- act as the voice of the end-user
- drum up awareness and excitement for Sourcegraph

They are an important part in driving adoption and usage. They give us a pulse into user sentiment. Through feedback they help us tailor and improve both the experience and product.

**Metrics**:

- Number of advocates
- Number of champions

### Ongoing alignment with customer value

A business case outlines the expected value Sourcegraph brings to a customer. A customer's expectations are set against this, and their argument to renew, and their appetite to expand, are achieved when they are confident Sourcegraph is in fact delivering against the promise. Customer success should ensure the business case is achievable, and achieved, updating when necessary as business conditions change.

**Playbooks**:

- [QBRs](customer-success-playbooks.md#business-review-with-customer)

### Maintain an in-depth knowledge of the account

There are 5 key areas that must be known and understood in order to ensure a customer sees as much value and experiences as little pain as possible with Sourcegraph. They are:

- Organisation: How is the customer organised? What development teams exist? How do they communicate? What initiatives affect these organisations, and how are they measured?
- People:
- Processes: Concrete examples for sales, as well as account health
- Tooling:
- Infrastructure:

**Documents**:

- [Techincal Design Document](customer-success-deliverables.md#technical-design-document)

### Ensure effective support structure

In order to achieve the best experience the customer must understand how to engage with Sourcegraph support and the CE must ensure all comunication relevant to support tickets are funneled to support for handling. Some customers will look to provide an internal support structure for their use of Sourcegraph, funnelling day-to-day user questions. Ensuring this team are fully equiped to engage with our support is important.

**Playbooks**:

- [Account Onboarding](customer-success-playbooks.md#account-onboarding)

### Ensure effective product feedback

Customers will raise bug feature requests, and sometimes roadmap items will benefit that customer (or may have beta programs that the customer may be interested in joining). Agreeing channels for clear, consistent, and frequent updates of all requests, issues, and roadmap news, will build trust.
