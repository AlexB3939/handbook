### How do I know if I'm being asked to review someone's proposal?

If someone has selected you as a reviewer or an approver, you will receive a notification from Github. You can also visit [this link](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review-requested%3A%40me) to see proposed Handbook changes waiting on a review from you.

### Can I review and comment on a proposal, even if I wasn't asked?

Yes! Our repo is public, and you can see new Handbook proposals in the #handbook-updates Slack channel. If something looks interesting to you, you're welcome to review and give feedback. In alignment with our [values](../company/values.md) to work as a team, act with high agency, and be open and transparent, teammates are encouraged to review and comment on proposals where they feel they can add value.
