## Quarterly Product/Eng All Hands Meetings

Our team is rapidly growing and we want to provide a forum to meet synchronously to:

- share department updates
- drive alignment around our mission and strategy
- celebrate wins and build engagement
- provide everyone an opportunity to ask questions

Audience

- All of Product/Engineering

Cadence

- Once a quarter (meeting will be recorded for those who can't attend live)

Format

- 45m zoom meeting

Content

- Content and themes are subject to change each quarter
- Content will be sent out at least a week in advance for people to review
- Each session will end with a Q&A portion
  - A link will be sent out a few days before the meeting for people to submit questions and upvote/comment on prioritization

## Recordings

The meeting recording,slides, and Q&A notes will be posted on Slack on #dev-announce and (TODO confirm what other channels) after the meeting finishes.

See our [company communication](/../communication) page for additional communication resources.
