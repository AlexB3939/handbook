## Why?

The competitive landscape for code search has shifted dramatically since the emergence of GitHub
(Microsoft) search. We are no longer the only enterprise-grade code search tool and we need adapt our
current pricing and packaging model to win the market.

## Project mission

Create a simple, pricing and packaging offering that differentiates us from our competition, reduces friction
for growth, and directly ties customer value to ARR.

### Project maxims

In an effort to create a simple, pricing and packaging offering that differentiates us from our competition,
reduces friction for growth, and directly ties customer value to ARR the pricing and packaging working group
believes:

- A flattened product offering will increase product value and differentiate us from our competition (GitHub).
  - How can we ensure the primary value of our product is tied to the “core workflow” and not to cross-sell / up-sell product add-ons?
- More devs using our product is the key to Sourcegraph’s success
  - How can we bring down the price point and associated barriers to entry?.
  - How can our product + pricing and packaging enable viral growth within our customers?
  - How can we pack the most value into our core workflows so that the power of our product is undeniable?
- Customers should only pay for what they use (MAU / DAU + Consumption based model)
  - How can we minimize shelfware? 
  - How can we tie customer need and value to ARR more directly (compute, executor packages, etc.)?
  - How can we create a pricing and packaging model that is simple yet flexible?
- We need to increase customer happiness and improve time to value by moving them away from self-hosted deployments and to single-instance cloud & custom cloud deployments.
  - How can we use pricing and packaging to nudge prospects and customers to these preferred deployment methodologies?
  - If / when customers choose self-hosted, how can we ensure customers are set up for success and Sourcegraph doesn’t operate at a loss due to increased operational overhead (air gapping, increased support, better SLAs, etc.)?
- ARR can’t be negatively impacted due to new pricing and packaging models.
  - Changes to our pricing and packaging model can’t negatively impact our existing ARR base.
  - There will likely be a downward pressure on our key sales / deal metrics (ARPU, ADS, etc.) but, how can we make up the difference with other revenue streams, increased deal volume, etc.?

## Current Proposal

The following proposal is the proposal created by the exec-team. This is NOT final. Rigorous, comment, collaboration, challenging of assumptions, analysis with data is still needed and expected. Please collaborate in #pricing and in the [Pricing and Packaging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RlHYn4h_oBnLAKFPJ5PJ3_KtekL5jFgg_Yc8AGx5_I/edit#) document

The exec-team has a strong belief that the final pricing and packaging model will contain:
1. A flattened product offering
2. MAU / DAU-based licensing model
3. Consumption-based pricing for scaled compute (batch changes, precise cose intelligence, etc.)
4. Enterprise cross-sell / up-sells for security, centralized management, scalability, etc.

### Overarching premise:

Create a simple, pricing and packaging offering that differentiates us from our competition, reduces
friction for growth, and directly ties customer value to ARR.

### Proposed Plans

General note: All proposed numbers and pricing suggestions are not final. These are stand-in values. We expect all numbers and pricing models to change to some extent. All ideas and thoughts are welcome! 


## Timeline

### Research and Diligence (2-3 weeks)

Week 1 - Present 1st proposal to pricing and packaging team for review, comment, challenge, change. Continue to refine the overall strategy, pricing and packaging components. Present findings, latest iteration to leadership for review and approval of direction.
Share with board
Week 2 - Continue to refine the overall strategy, pricing and packaging components. Present findings, latest iteration to leadership for review and approval of direction. Continue to run more refined analysis on potential impact to financials and GTM strategy with the new model.
Start bringing in ICs in sales, CE, for feedback on new pricing and packaging strategy
Start working on rollout plan
Accounting for billing
Finance for forecasting
Enablement for training
Product Marketing for content updates
CE for demo updates
Week 3 - Goal will be to have the core components of the new pricing and packaging model solidified.
Set tiers / offerings
Set components within each tier
Set fees and pricing mechanism for each component

### Deep analysis and begin rolling out internal implementation plan (2-4 weeks)

Week 4 - Finance, Accounting, Sales Finance continue to analyze impacts of new pricing and packaging models.
Implementation plans continue to get flushed out.
Weeks 5 to 7 - Target soft and hard launch dates
Softlaunch - ideally some time in late august / early september. We enable and train up AEs to start selling under the new pricing model. Iterate and learn.
Hard launch - We publically announce the new pricing and packaging to our customers in conjunction with the Sourcegraph 4.0 (Sept 27th).

### Implement, train, and roll out (4 weeks)

Week 8 - Soft launch while we continue to implement and roll out new billing, forecasting, training, enablement, content changes and update
Weeks 9 to 11 - continue to implement and roll out new billing, forecasting, training, enablement, content changes and update
Week 12 - Hard launch

## Success criteria & ongoing support

### Success criteria

We will consider this project a success when:
Pricing and packaging content is finalized, agreed on
New pricing and packaging page is updated on the website
New pricing and packaging sales training and content has been rolled out to the field.
Operations is able / capable to process deals, perform financial tasks (billing, forecasting, etc.)

### Ongoing support

Once the new pricing and packaging is rolled out it will jointly be supported, enhanced, and maintained by the various business units who will leverage the pricing and packaging policies to do their jobs.

No one group can make unilateral changes to the pricing and packaging content, but will work with the CEO team on changes if / when the need arises in the future.
